DENVER (AP) -- A man from Ukraine has been arrested at Denver International Airport after he was accused of interfering with two flight attendants on a Delta Airlines flight.

The U.S. Department of Justice says 42-year-old Vadym Pecherskyi, of Kiev, Ukraine, is accused of making sexual advances toward two female flight attendants on a flight to Denver from Atlanta on Monday.

The department issued a statement saying the man could be charged with interfering with flight crew members, which carries a possible sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Pecherskyi is scheduled to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge on Wednesday, where he will be advised of charges pending against him.

Federal court records did not indicate whether Pecherskyi has an attorney.
