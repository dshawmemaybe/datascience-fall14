HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- The western Maryland city of Hagerstown is enacting a tougher juvenile curfew that makes parents subject to fines.

The Herald-Mail (http://bit.ly/1rzR0vK ) reports that the City Council voted unanimously in favor of the changes Tuesday. The new law takes effect Nov. 28.

It raises the curfew age limit from 15 to 16. And it moves up the time that unaccompanied children must be indoors by one hour. Under the new law, they must be off the streets by 10 p.m. weeknights and 11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays.

Violations are subject to fines ranging from $100 to $500 for repeat offenses.

The changes follow increased complaints about juvenile crime in the city.
